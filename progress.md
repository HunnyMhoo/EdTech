# Progress Log

## 2025-06-11 (Phase 3: Frontend-Backend Integration)

### Changes
- **Completed Frontend-Backend Integration & API Alignment:**
  - **API Configuration Synchronization:** Fixed critical mismatch between frontend and backend server configurations. Updated `frontend/src/config.ts` to use `http://127.0.0.1:8000` instead of `http://localhost:8000`, ensuring consistent communication with the backend server.
  - **Backend API Parameter Consistency:** Resolved parameter mismatch in mission progress updates. Removed the `status` parameter from the `update_mission_progress` function call in `backend/routes/missions.py`, aligning with the refined completion logic that automatically determines mission status based on progress.
  - **Frontend Service Integration:** Updated frontend API layer to match backend behavior:
    - Modified `MissionProgressUpdatePayload` interface in `frontend/src/features/mission/api/missionApi.ts` to remove optional status parameter
    - Refactored `useMission` hook in `frontend/src/features/mission/hooks/useMission.ts` to remove manual status management, relying on backend's automatic status determination
    - Fixed notification service import path to use correct `@/shared/services/notificationService` location
- **Comprehensive Integration Testing:**
  - Created and executed 10 comprehensive integration tests covering the complete user journey
  - Validated end-to-end functionality: mission generation, progress tracking, automatic completion detection, and state persistence
  - Confirmed API responses match frontend expectations with proper question structure, choices, and feedback data
  - Verified multi-user support with clean mission generation for different users
- **Service Layer Alignment:**
  - Ensured consistent usage of `mission_progress_service.update_mission_progress` function, which automatically manages mission completion status
  - Maintained backward compatibility with existing mission completion logic from 2024-08-03 refinements
  - Validated proper integration between mission generation, progress tracking, and lifecycle management services

## 2025-06-11 (Original Backend Fix)

### Changes
- **Fixed Critical Backend Server Question Loading Issue:**
  - **Root Cause Identified:** The backend server was successfully starting but failing to load any questions from the CSV file due to a data structure mismatch. The `Question` model expected a `correct_answer_id` field (string) and multiple choice options, but the existing CSV file (`backend/data/gat_questions.csv`) only contained basic question information without the required fields.
  - **CSV Data Structure Enhancement:**
    - Completely restructured `backend/data/gat_questions.csv` to include proper multiple choice question format with:
      - Added choice columns: `choice_1_id`, `choice_1_text`, `choice_2_id`, `choice_2_text`, `choice_3_id`, `choice_3_text`, `choice_4_id`, `choice_4_text`
      - Added `correct_answer_id` field mapping to the correct choice ID (a, b, c, or d)
      - Maintained all existing question content while adding meaningful multiple choice options for each question
    - Created proper multiple choice options for all 10 GAT questions covering Vocabulary, Logical Reasoning, Analogies, Reading Comprehension, Classification, Word Formation, and Number Series
  - **Backend Server Functionality Restored:**
    - All 10 questions now load successfully into the database cache without validation errors
    - Mission generation endpoints now function correctly and can generate daily missions with 5 random questions
    - Question detail endpoints (e.g., `/api/questions/GATQ001`) now return complete question data with choices and correct answers
    - Health check endpoint confirms server is operational at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/health`
  - **Validation Results:**
    - Confirmed individual question retrieval works: `GET /api/questions/GATQ001` returns complete question with choices
    - Verified daily mission generation: `GET /api/missions/daily/test_user_123` successfully creates missions with 5 questions
    - Server logs show "Successfully loaded 10 questions into cache from database" instead of previous "0 questions" error

## 2024-08-03

### Changes
- **Refined Mission Completion Logic:**
  - Implemented a stricter and more robust definition of mission completion, as defined in the user story. A mission is now only marked as `complete` after a user has both answered all questions and viewed the feedback for every answer.
  - **Refactored `mission_progress_service`:**
    - Created a new private helper function, `_is_mission_complete`, to encapsulate the business logic for checking completion status. This improves modularity and clarifies the purpose of the `update_mission_progress` function.
    - The `update_mission_progress` function now automatically sets the mission status to `complete` based on the outcome of the new helper function, removing the need for the frontend to manage this state transition explicitly.
  - **Enhanced Unit Test Coverage:**
    - Added comprehensive unit tests in `test_mission_service.py` to validate the new completion logic under various scenarios, including:
      - A mission becoming `complete` only after all conditions are met.
      - A mission remaining `in_progress` if a user has answered all questions but not viewed all feedback.
    - Updated existing tests to align with the new, more robust implementation.

## 2024-08-02

### Changes
- **Frontend Project Structure Enhancement:**
  - **Removed Redundancy:** Eliminated the unnecessary nested `frontend/frontend` directory, which contained a duplicate `__mocks__` folder. This declutters the project and removes potential confusion.
  - **Established Scalable Foundation:** Created a more organized and conventional folder structure by adding the following new directories to `frontend/`:
    - `assets`: For shared images, fonts, and icons.
    - `navigation`: For centralizing navigation logic (navigators, routes).
    - `state`: For global state management (e.g., Redux, Zustand, Context).
    - `styles`: For global stylesheets, themes, and design tokens.
    - `utils`: For reusable helper functions.
    - `constants`: For application-wide constants.

## 2024-08-01

### Changes
- **Frontend Architectural Refactoring:**
  - **Improved Modularity:** Refactored the `MissionScreen` into smaller, reusable components (`QuestionDisplay`, `ChoiceList`, `MissionNav`). This simplifies the screen's logic, turning it into a "smart" container that manages state while delegating rendering to "dumb" presentational components.
  - **Decoupled Business Logic from UI:** Abstracted all `Alert.alert` calls from the `useMission` hook into a dedicated `notificationService`. This decouples core application logic from specific UI framework components, improving testability and reusability.
  - **Centralized Configuration:** Removed hardcoded API endpoints from the `missionApi` service. All environment-specific variables, such as `API_BASE_URL`, are now managed in a central `frontend/config.ts` file.
  - **Standardized Test Architecture:**
    - Relocated all test files to be co-located with their corresponding source files (e.g., `missionApi.ts` and `missionApi.test.ts` now reside in the same directory).
    - Removed empty and redundant `__tests__` directories to create a flatter, more predictable testing structure.
    - Added TypeScript type definitions for `jest-fetch-mock` to resolve linter errors and provide proper type support in the test environment.

## 2024-07-31

### Changes
- **Project-Wide Refactoring & Maintainability Improvements:**
  - **Backend Configuration:** Centralized all environment variables and application settings into a single `backend/config.py` module using Pydantic. This eliminates hardcoded values and provides runtime type validation for configuration. Refactored all services and database initializers to use this central config.
  - **Standardized Module Imports:** Configured path aliases (e.g., `@components`, `@hooks`) for the entire frontend codebase. This was implemented across `babel.config.js`, `tsconfig.json`, and `jest.config.js` to ensure consistency. All relative import paths (`../../`) in screen and component files have been refactored to use these cleaner aliases.
  - **Improved Tooling & Scripts:**
    - Created a root `Makefile` to provide a standardized interface for common backend tasks (`install-deps`, `run-dev`, `test`, `lint`).
    - Added `lint` and `format` scripts to the frontend `package.json` to enforce code quality.
  - **Backend Test Suite:** Fixed the entire backend test suite, which was failing due to module import errors and incorrect test setup. This included adding `__init__.py` files, setting the `PYTHONPATH`, and correcting mock data to align with current data models.
  - **Frontend Test Environment:** Addressed a critical flaw in the Jest setup by removing faulty and outdated mocks from `jest.setup.js`. While this fixed the environment, persistent module resolution issues prevent the test suite from passing, indicating a deeper tooling conflict that requires further investigation.

### Changes
- **TypeScript Configuration:**
  - Deleted the root `tsconfig.json` to resolve conflicts with the more specific `frontend/tsconfig.json`.
  - Simplified `frontend/tsconfig.json` by removing redundant compiler options and inheriting from the base React Native configuration.
  - Added `typescript` as a `devDependency` to `package.json` to ensure proper compilation with `ts-jest`.

### Bug Fixes
- Resolved TypeScript compilation errors caused by conflicting configurations and a missing `typescript` dependency.
