# Progress Log

## 2024-08-03

### Changes
- **Refined Mission Completion Logic:**
  - Implemented a stricter and more robust definition of mission completion, as defined in the user story. A mission is now only marked as `complete` after a user has both answered all questions and viewed the feedback for every answer.
  - **Refactored `mission_progress_service`:**
    - Created a new private helper function, `_is_mission_complete`, to encapsulate the business logic for checking completion status. This improves modularity and clarifies the purpose of the `update_mission_progress` function.
    - The `update_mission_progress` function now automatically sets the mission status to `complete` based on the outcome of the new helper function, removing the need for the frontend to manage this state transition explicitly.
  - **Enhanced Unit Test Coverage:**
    - Added comprehensive unit tests in `test_mission_service.py` to validate the new completion logic under various scenarios, including:
      - A mission becoming `complete` only after all conditions are met.
      - A mission remaining `in_progress` if a user has answered all questions but not viewed all feedback.
    - Updated existing tests to align with the new, more robust implementation.

### Changes
- **Frontend Project Structure Enhancement:**
  - **Removed Redundancy:** Eliminated the unnecessary nested `frontend/frontend` directory, which contained a duplicate `__mocks__` folder. This declutters the project and removes potential confusion.
  - **Established Scalable Foundation:** Created a more organized and conventional folder structure by adding the following new directories to `frontend/`:
    - `assets`: For shared images, fonts, and icons.
    - `navigation`: For centralizing navigation logic (navigators, routes).
    - `state`: For global state management (e.g., Redux, Zustand, Context).
    - `styles`: For global stylesheets, themes, and design tokens.
    - `utils`: For reusable helper functions.
    - `constants`: For application-wide constants.

### Changes
- **Frontend Architectural Refactoring:**
  - **Improved Modularity:** Refactored the `MissionScreen` into smaller, reusable components (`QuestionDisplay`, `ChoiceList`, `MissionNav`). This simplifies the screen's logic, turning it into a "smart" container that manages state while delegating rendering to "dumb" presentational components.
  - **Decoupled Business Logic from UI:** Abstracted all `Alert.alert` calls from the `useMission` hook into a dedicated `notificationService`. This decouples core application logic from specific UI framework components, improving testability and reusability.
  - **Centralized Configuration:** Removed hardcoded API endpoints from the `missionApi` service. All environment-specific variables, such as `API_BASE_URL`, are now managed in a central `frontend/config.ts` file.
  - **Standardized Test Architecture:**
    - Relocated all test files to be co-located with their corresponding source files (e.g., `missionApi.ts` and `missionApi.test.ts` now reside in the same directory).
    - Removed empty and redundant `__tests__` directories to create a flatter, more predictable testing structure.
    - Added TypeScript type definitions for `jest-fetch-mock` to resolve linter errors and provide proper type support in the test environment.

### Changes
- **Project-Wide Refactoring & Maintainability Improvements:**
  - **Backend Configuration:** Centralized all environment variables and application settings into a single `backend/config.py` module using Pydantic. This eliminates hardcoded values and provides runtime type validation for configuration. Refactored all services and database initializers to use this central config.
  - **Standardized Module Imports:** Configured path aliases (e.g., `@components`, `@hooks`) for the entire frontend codebase. This was implemented across `babel.config.js`, `tsconfig.json`, and `jest.config.js` to ensure consistency. All relative import paths (`../../`) in screen and component files have been refactored to use these cleaner aliases.
  - **Improved Tooling & Scripts:**
    - Created a root `Makefile` to provide a standardized interface for common backend tasks (`install-deps`, `run-dev`, `test`, `lint`).
    - Added `lint` and `format` scripts to the frontend `package.json` to enforce code quality.
  - **Backend Test Suite:** Fixed the entire backend test suite, which was failing due to module import errors and incorrect test setup. This included adding `__init__.py` files, setting the `PYTHONPATH`, and correcting mock data to align with current data models.
  - **Frontend Test Environment:** Addressed a critical flaw in the Jest setup by removing faulty and outdated mocks from `jest.setup.js`. While this fixed the environment, persistent module resolution issues prevent the test suite from passing, indicating a deeper tooling conflict that requires further investigation.

### Changes
- **TypeScript Configuration:**
  - Deleted the root `tsconfig.json` to resolve conflicts with the more specific `frontend/tsconfig.json`.
  - Simplified `frontend/tsconfig.json` by removing redundant compiler options and inheriting from the base React Native configuration.
  - Added `typescript` as a `devDependency` to `package.json` to ensure proper compilation with `ts-jest`.

### Bug Fixes
- Resolved TypeScript compilation errors caused by conflicting configurations and a missing `typescript` dependency.
