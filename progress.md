### Changes
- **Project-Wide Refactoring & Maintainability Improvements:**
  - **Backend Configuration:** Centralized all environment variables and application settings into a single `backend/config.py` module using Pydantic. This eliminates hardcoded values and provides runtime type validation for configuration. Refactored all services and database initializers to use this central config.
  - **Standardized Module Imports:** Configured path aliases (e.g., `@components`, `@hooks`) for the entire frontend codebase. This was implemented across `babel.config.js`, `tsconfig.json`, and `jest.config.js` to ensure consistency. All relative import paths (`../../`) in screen and component files have been refactored to use these cleaner aliases.
  - **Improved Tooling & Scripts:**
    - Created a root `Makefile` to provide a standardized interface for common backend tasks (`install-deps`, `run-dev`, `test`, `lint`).
    - Added `lint` and `format` scripts to the frontend `package.json` to enforce code quality.
  - **Backend Test Suite:** Fixed the entire backend test suite, which was failing due to module import errors and incorrect test setup. This included adding `__init__.py` files, setting the `PYTHONPATH`, and correcting mock data to align with current data models.
  - **Frontend Test Environment:** Addressed a critical flaw in the Jest setup by removing faulty and outdated mocks from `jest.setup.js`. While this fixed the environment, persistent module resolution issues prevent the test suite from passing, indicating a deeper tooling conflict that requires further investigation.

### Changes
- **TypeScript Configuration:**
  - Deleted the root `tsconfig.json` to resolve conflicts with the more specific `frontend/tsconfig.json`.
  - Simplified `frontend/tsconfig.json` by removing redundant compiler options and inheriting from the base React Native configuration.
  - Added `typescript` as a `devDependency` to `package.json` to ensure proper compilation with `ts-jest`.

### Bug Fixes
- Resolved TypeScript compilation errors caused by conflicting configurations and a missing `typescript` dependency.
