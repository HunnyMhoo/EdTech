### Changes
- **TypeScript Configuration:**
  - Deleted the root `tsconfig.json` to resolve conflicts with the more specific `frontend/tsconfig.json`.
  - Simplified `frontend/tsconfig.json` by removing redundant compiler options and inheriting from the base React Native configuration.
  - Added `typescript` as a `devDependency` to `package.json` to ensure proper compilation with `ts-jest`.

### Bug Fixes
- Resolved TypeScript compilation errors caused by conflicting configurations and a missing `typescript` dependency.
