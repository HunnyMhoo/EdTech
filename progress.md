### Task 2: Create Daily Mission Generation Service - Completed

*   **Implemented Core Service:** Developed the `DailyMissionGenerationService` in `backend/services/mission_service.py`. This service is responsible for creating new daily missions for users.
*   **Question Pool from CSV:** Integrated logic to load question IDs from a `gat_questions.csv` file located in `backend/data/`. This allows for easy management of the GAT question pool.
*   **Timezone Handling:** Implemented timezone-aware date handling, ensuring missions are generated based on a UTC+7 daily boundary.
*   **Duplicate Prevention:** Added checks to prevent the generation of more than one mission per user per day.
*   **Error Handling:** Incorporated error handling for scenarios such as an insufficient number of questions in the pool or if the question CSV file is not found. Custom exceptions (`NoQuestionsAvailableError`, `MissionAlreadyExistsError`) were defined for clarity.
*   **Mock Database Integration:** Utilized mock in-memory functions (`_find_mission_in_db`, `_save_mission_to_db`) to simulate database interactions, allowing the service to be developed and tested independently of the actual database schema implementation (Task 1).
*   **Unit Testing:** Created a comprehensive suite of unit tests in `backend/tests/unit/test_mission_service.py`. These tests cover successful mission generation, duplicate handling, timezone logic, insufficient questions, file errors, and other edge cases.
*   **Manual Verification Script:** Included an `if __name__ == '__main__':` block in `mission_service.py` for easy manual verification of the service's core functionalities.
