## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The system implements a daily educational mission platform specifically designed for Thai GAT เชื่อมโยง practice, operating with strict timezone-specific rules (UTC+7).

Core Business Components:

1. Daily Mission System (Importance: 95)
- Generates exactly 5 random questions per daily mission
- Enforces single active mission per user per day
- Maintains mission states: NOT_STARTED, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETE, ARCHIVED
- Automatically archives incomplete missions at daily reset

Key files:
```
backend/services/mission_service.py
frontend/screens/MissionScreen.tsx
```

2. Question Progression Engine (Importance: 85)
- Enforces sequential question completion
- Validates answers before allowing progression
- Prevents modification of submitted answers
- Tracks current_question_index for progress management

Key files:
```
frontend/services/missionApi.ts
backend/routes/missions.py
```

3. Mission Lifecycle Management (Importance: 80)
- Daily reset process at 4:00 AM UTC
- Archives incomplete missions from previous day
- Maintains mission availability periods
- Handles mission state transitions

Key files:
```
backend/jobs/daily_reset.py
```

4. Educational Content Management (Importance: 75)
- Thai-language feedback support
- Question categorization by skill areas
- Difficulty level assignment
- Multiple-choice format with answer validation

The system architecture emphasizes strict progression rules and daily engagement patterns, specifically tailored for Thai educational requirements and timezone considerations.
