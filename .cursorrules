## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The system implements a daily mission generation and delivery platform with timezone-specific content management.

**Path:** `backend/routes/missions.py`
**Importance Score:** 85

Handles mission delivery through:
- User-specific mission retrieval
- Daily mission access control
- Integration with mission generation service

### Frontend Mission Display
**Path:** `frontend/screens/HomeScreen.tsx`
**Importance Score:** 75

Manages mission presentation through:
- Daily mission content display

### Mission API Service
**Path:** `frontend/services/missionApi.ts`
**Importance Score:** 70

Facilitates mission data flow:
- Backend mission data retrieval

- Development environment simulation

## Business Workflow

1. System checks for existing daily missions using UTC+7 timezone
2. Generates new missions if none exist for current date
3. Ensures each user receives unique question sets
4. Delivers missions through API endpoint
5. Presents missions to users through frontend interface
