## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


### Core Mission Management System
Importance Score: 95

- Maintains mission states: NOT_STARTED, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETE, ARCHIVED
- Validates question pool availability and prevents duplicate missions
- Enforces UTC+7 timezone alignment for Thai users

2. Mission Data Management (`backend/models/daily_mission.py`)
- Tracks user progress, answers, and completion status
- Maintains question sequences and response history
- Associates missions with specific dates and user IDs

3. Automated Maintenance (`backend/jobs/daily_reset.py`)
- Archives incomplete missions at 4:00 AM UTC
- Maintains data cleanliness for active missions
- Prepares system for new daily content

### Mission Progress Workflow
Importance Score: 85

The progress tracking system (`backend/routes/missions.py`) manages:
- User-specific mission retrieval
- Progress state transitions
- Answer submission and validation
- Mission completion verification

### Mission Status Management
Importance Score: 80

The status system enforces:
- Single active mission per user per day
- Proper transition between mission states
- Archival of expired missions
- Progress persistence across sessions

### Error Handling
