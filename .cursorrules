## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The EdTech platform implements a daily mission system with the following core business components:

### Mission Generation Engine (Importance: 95)
- Located in `backend/services/mission_service.py`
- Generates personalized daily sets of 5 unique questions per user
- Handles mission state transitions and archiving based on UTC+7 timezone
- Prevents duplicate missions and handles insufficient question scenarios

### Mission Progress Management (Importance: 90) 
- Tracks user progress through `frontend/hooks/useMission.ts`
- Maintains mission states: not_started, in_progress, completed
- Saves partial progress to allow mission resumption
- Archives incomplete missions during daily reset at 4:00 AM UTC

### Question Management System (Importance: 85)
- Question repository initialization and seeding from CSV
- In-memory caching for rapid question access
- Validation of question uniqueness within missions
- Custom data models for structured question content

### User Feedback System (Importance: 80)
- Immediate feedback after answer submission
- Shows correct/incorrect status with explanations
- Tracks question-level progress within missions
- Updates mission status based on completion criteria

### Mission API Layer (Importance: 75)
- Daily mission fetching and progress updates
- Timezone-aware mission delivery (UTC+7)
- Standardized response formats for mission data
- Error handling for mission generation failures

The system organizes these components to deliver a cohesive educational experience through daily missions, with strong emphasis on progress tracking and immediate feedback to support learning objectives.
