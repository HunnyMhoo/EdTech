### Daily Mission Data Model (Importance: 95)
Located in `backend/models/daily_mission.py`
- DailyMissionDocument schema encompasses:
  - User identification
  - Mission date (UTC+7 timezone)
  - Set of 5 randomly selected question IDs
  - Mission status tracking (NOT_STARTED, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETE, ARCHIVED)
  - Current question index
  - User answers and timestamps

### Mission Generation Flow (Importance: 90)
Located in `backend/services/mission_service.py`
- Validates question pool availability
- Generates unique 5-question sets per user
- Prevents duplicate mission creation for same date
- Handles timezone-specific date determination (UTC+7)
- Enforces mission status transitions

### Data Archival Flow (Importance: 85)
Located in `backend/jobs/daily_reset.py`
- Scheduled execution at 4:00 AM UTC
- Archives incomplete missions from previous days
- Maintains data integrity through status validation
- Ensures clean transition between daily cycles

### API Response Structures (Importance: 80)
Located in `backend/models/api_responses.py` and `backend/routes/missions.py`
- MissionResponse model for daily mission data
- ErrorResponse model for validation/business rule violations
- Structured responses for mission progress updates
- Timezone-aware response formatting

### Mission Progress Flow (Importance: 75)
Located in `backend/services/mission_service.py`
- Tracks user progression through questions
- Updates mission status based on completion
- Validates answer submissions
- Maintains mission completion timestamps
