### Core Mission Data Model
Importance Score: 95

The daily mission model represents the core educational content structure:

```typescript
interface DailyMission {
  id: string
  userId: string 
  status: MissionStatus
  questions: Question[]
  answers: UserAnswer[]
  createdAt: Date
  completedAt?: Date
}
```

Key business rules:
- Each mission contains exactly 5 unique questions
- Missions reset daily at 4:00 AM UTC+7 (Thailand timezone)
- Statuses transition from not_started -> in_progress -> completed
- Incomplete missions are archived during daily reset

### API Response Structure 
Importance Score: 85

Mission-specific API responses follow a standardized format:

```typescript
interface MissionResponse {
  mission: DailyMission
  feedback?: {
    isCorrect: boolean
    explanation: string
  }
  errors?: string[]
}
```

### Data Flow
Importance Score: 90

1. Mission Generation
- Backend generates daily missions at 4:00 AM UTC+7
- Questions are randomly selected based on user's progress
- Duplicate questions are prevented within 7-day window

2. Mission Retrieval
- Frontend fetches mission via `fetchDailyMission` 
- Backend validates mission freshness against UTC+7
- Expired missions trigger new generation

3. Progress Updates
- Frontend submits answers via `updateMissionProgressApi`
- Backend validates answers and updates mission status
- Response includes feedback and explanation

### Timezone Handling
Importance Score: 80

The system standardizes on UTC+7 (Thailand) for all mission-related operations:
- Mission generation and reset timing
- Date comparisons for mission freshness
- Archival of incomplete missions
- Frontend display of mission availability
