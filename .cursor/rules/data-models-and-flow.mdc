## Mission Data Model (Importance: 95)
`backend/models/daily_mission.py`
- Daily mission structure contains exactly 5 questions per user
- Mission states: NOT_STARTED, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETE, ARCHIVED
- Question model includes: question_id, text, skill_area, difficulty_level, choices
- Thai-language feedback support integrated into question model

## API Response Structures (Importance: 85)
`backend/models/api_responses.py`
- Mission progress tracking response includes current_question_index and answer history
- Question response format standardizes choice options and feedback delivery
- Mission state transitions handled through structured status updates
- Timezone-aware timestamps using UTC+7 standard

## Data Flow Architecture (Importance: 90)
`frontend/services/missionApi.ts`, `backend/routes/missions.py`
- Frontend maintains mission state with progress caching
- Backend manages mission lifecycle including:
  - Daily mission generation with timezone rules
  - Progress state synchronization
  - Answer validation and feedback delivery
- Bi-directional sync ensures consistent mission states

## Mission Progress Management (Importance: 80)
`backend/services/mission_service.py`
- User-specific mission tracking with daily reset boundaries
- Answer persistence with validation rules
- Automatic archival of incomplete missions at day boundary
- Mission date calculations use UTC+7 timezone for Thai operations
