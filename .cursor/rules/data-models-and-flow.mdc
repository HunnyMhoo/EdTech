   - Prevents duplicate mission generation for same day
   - Importance Score: 90

2. Mission Retrieval Flow
   - Frontend requests missions via `/missions/today` endpoint
   - Backend checks existing missions before generation
   - Returns standardized API response structure
   - Importance Score: 85

**Timezone Management**
- System operates on UTC+7 timezone
- Ensures consistent mission availability for target audience
- Date calculations factor timezone for mission uniqueness
- Importance Score: 80

**Data Storage Pattern**
- In-memory dictionary simulates persistent storage
- Stores missions keyed by user ID and date
- Enables mission retrieval and uniqueness validation
- Importance Score: 75

**Frontend Data Integration**
