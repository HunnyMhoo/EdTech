# mission-generation-algorithm

### Core Mission Generation Logic
- Enforces daily mission generation with exactly 5 unique questions per user
- Validates question pool availability before generation
- Prevents duplicate missions for same user/date
- Maintains mission state transitions: NOT_STARTED -> IN_PROGRESS -> COMPLETE/ARCHIVED

### Mission Lifecycle Management
- Archives incomplete missions at UTC+7 timezone boundary
- Auto-transitions mission states based on user progress and feedback views
- Handles mission regeneration when prior missions expire

### Question Selection Algorithm
**File:** `backend/services/mission_generation_service.py`
```
Importance Score: 95
- Random selection from qualified question pool
- Enforces uniqueness within each mission
- Validates minimum question availability (5)
- Persists mission with NOT_STARTED status
```

### Mission Progress Tracking
**File:** `backend/services/mission_progress_service.py`
```
Importance Score: 85
- Tracks completion state per question
- Requires feedback view for completion
- Auto-updates mission status based on progress
- Manages state transitions for partial completion
```

### Timezone-Specific Operations
**File:** `backend/services/utils.py`
```
Importance Score: 75
- Synchronizes mission generation with UTC+7
- Handles date boundaries for Thai student audience
- Coordinates mission archival timing
```

### Question Repository Management
**File:** `backend/repositories/question_repository.py`
```
Importance Score: 70
- Initializes question pool from CSV source
- Maintains in-memory question cache
- Provides atomic question retrieval operations
```

Key Features:
- Single mission per user per day enforcement
- Strict 5-question requirement
- Timezone-aligned operations (UTC+7)
- Question uniqueness guarantees
- Automated mission lifecycle management
- Progress-based state transitions
- Feedback view requirement for completion
