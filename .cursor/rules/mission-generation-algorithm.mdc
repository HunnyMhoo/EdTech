# mission-generation-algorithm

## Core Generation Logic (Importance: 95)
- Generates unique sets of 5 questions per user per day
- Uses UTC+7 timezone alignment for target audience date calculations
- Validates existing missions before generating new ones to prevent duplicates
- Maintains user-specific mission assignment tracking

## Error Handling & Validation (Importance: 85)
Custom exception types:
- `MissionGenerationError`: General generation failures
- `NoQuestionsAvailableError`: Insufficient questions for mission creation 
- `MissionAlreadyExistsError`: Duplicate mission prevention

## Storage Implementation (Importance: 80)
- In-memory dictionary storage simulates database persistence
- Stores missions by user ID and date
- Maintains mission-user mappings for uniqueness validation

## Key File Components
```
backend/services/mission_service.py
├── Mission generation core logic
├── Timezone handling (UTC+7)
└── Exception handling

backend/models/daily_mission.py
└── Mission data structure definition

backend/routes/missions.py
└── Mission retrieval endpoint (/missions/today)
```

## Business Rules
1. Each user receives exactly 5 questions per daily mission
2. Missions regenerate at UTC+7 midnight
3. Users cannot receive duplicate missions on the same day
4. Questions must be unique within each mission set
