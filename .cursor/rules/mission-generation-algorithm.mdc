# mission-generation-algorithm

The mission generation algorithm implements core business logic for creating and managing daily missions:

## Question Selection Logic [Importance: 95]
- Generates unique sets of 5 daily questions per user
- Maintains question pool exhaustion tracking
- Ensures no question repetition until user completes and views feedback for all questions
- File: `backend/services/mission_generation_service.py`

## Progress Tracking [Importance: 85]
- Tracks completion status per question
- Implements 3-attempt limit per question
- Records attempt history while allowing question state resets for retries
- File: `backend/services/mission_progress_service.py`

## Mission Completion Rules [Importance: 90]
- Mission marked complete when:
  - All questions answered correctly OR
  - Maximum attempts reached for all questions AND
  - All feedback viewed by user
- Maintains mission state in `daily_mission.py`

## Feedback Processing [Importance: 80]
- Immediate feedback generation after answer submission
- Includes correctness status, correct answer, explanation
- Tracks and manages feedback view status
- Essential for question pool progression

## Question Pool Management [Importance: 85]
- Tracks exhausted questions per user
- Resets question availability after feedback viewing
- Maintains user-specific question history
- Ensures complete question pool coverage before repeats
