### Core Mission Generation Logic (Importance: 95)
- Generates 5 randomly selected questions per user daily
- Uses UTC+7 timezone alignment for Thailand-specific mission timing
- Enforces uniqueness constraints to prevent duplicate missions per user per day
- Validates question pool availability before mission creation

### Mission Status Management (Importance: 85)
- Tracks mission states:
  - NOT_STARTED: Initial state for newly generated missions
  - IN_PROGRESS: Active missions being attempted
  - COMPLETE: Successfully finished missions
  - ARCHIVED: Past incomplete missions
- Handles transitions between states based on user progress

### Daily Reset Workflow (Importance: 80)
- Executes at 4:00 AM UTC daily
- Archives incomplete missions from previous days
- Maintains data integrity by only archiving eligible missions
- Prepares system for new daily mission generation

### Question Selection Rules (Importance: 90)
- Randomly selects from available question pool
- Prevents mission creation if insufficient questions exist
- Raises NoQuestionsAvailableError when pool is depleted
- Validates against MissionAlreadyExistsError for same day/user

### Progress Tracking (Importance: 75)
- Stores current question index
- Maintains answer history
- Updates mission status based on completion
- Records timestamps for mission events
