# mission-generation-algorithm

The mission generation algorithm implements core business logic for creating personalized daily missions:

### Mission Creation Rules
- Generates exactly 5 unique questions per daily mission per user
- Questions are selected from a pre-populated question repository 
- Same user cannot receive duplicate missions on the same day
- Missions reset at 4:00 AM UTC+7 (Thailand timezone)

### Question Selection Logic
1. Checks question repository cache for available questions
2. Filters out questions already used in user's previous missions
3. Randomly selects 5 questions from remaining pool
4. Raises MissionGenerationError if insufficient unique questions available
5. Associates selected questions with user's daily mission

### Mission Status Management 
- Status transitions:
  - not_started -> in_progress (on first answer)
  - in_progress -> completed (all questions answered)
  - in_progress -> archived (at daily reset if incomplete)

### Error Handling
Custom domain exceptions:
- MissionGenerationError: General generation failures
- NoQuestionsAvailableError: Insufficient unique questions
- MissionAlreadyExistsError: Duplicate mission detected

### Archival Process
- Daily job archives incomplete missions from previous day
- Uses UTC+7 timezone for determining mission expiry
- Maintains mission history for user progress tracking
