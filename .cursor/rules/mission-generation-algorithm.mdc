# mission-generation-algorithm

Core algorithm components for daily educational mission generation and management.

Mission Generation Rules (Importance: 95)
- Generates exactly 5 randomly selected questions per daily mission
- Ensures question uniqueness within each mission
- Operates on UTC+7 timezone for Thai educational system alignment 
- Enforces single active mission per user per day
- Requires minimum question pool size of 5 for mission creation

Question Selection Logic (Importance: 90)
- Randomly selects questions specific to GAT เชื่อมโยง content
- Questions must include skill area and difficulty level attributes
- Supports Thai-language feedback for each question
- Maintains question cache for performance optimization
- Prevents duplicate questions within same mission

Mission Status Workflow (Importance: 85)
- Tracks four distinct states: NOT_STARTED, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETE, ARCHIVED
- Automatically archives incomplete missions at daily reset (4:00 AM UTC)
- Implements grace period of 1 hour for missed reset executions
- Maintains user progression through question_index tracking

Progress Management (Importance: 80)
- Enforces sequential question progression
- Prevents modification of previously submitted answers
- Validates mission completion based on answer requirements
- Maintains separate answer state from question progression
- Implements automatic progress saving during navigation
