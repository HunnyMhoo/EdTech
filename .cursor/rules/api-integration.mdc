## API Contract

### Mission Endpoints
`/missions/today` 
- Retrieves or generates user's daily mission set
- Returns 5 unique questions for the current date
- Uses UTC+7 timezone for date calculations
- Requires user authentication (placeholder implemented)

### Response Models
File: `backend/models/api_responses.py`
- Daily mission response includes:
  - Mission date (UTC+7)
  - Set of 5 unique questions
  - User-specific mission identifiers

### Error Handling
Custom domain exceptions with specific error responses:
- MissionGenerationError
- NoQuestionsAvailableError  
- MissionAlreadyExistsError

## Integration Points

### Frontend Mission Service
File: `frontend/services/missionApi.ts`
- Abstracts backend API interactions
- Handles daily mission retrieval 
- Development mock data support

### Backend Route Handlers 
File: `backend/routes/missions.py`
- Mission generation endpoint
- User context handling
- Date-based mission validation

Business Logic Importance Scores:
- Mission API Contract: 95 (Core integration specification)
- Error Domain Models: 85 (Critical for business state handling)
- Frontend Integration Layer: 75 (Key service abstractions)
