## API Contract

### Mission Management Endpoints

`/api/missions`
- Purpose: Daily mission lifecycle management
- Response Format: Structured mission objects with status, questions, and progress
- Key Parameters: user_id, mission_date (UTC+7)

### Status States
- NOT_STARTED: Initial mission state
- IN_PROGRESS: Active mission with partial completion
- COMPLETE: All questions answered
- ARCHIVED: Past incomplete missions

### Progress Tracking
Integration between frontend mission service and backend tracking:
- Question index syncing
- Answer history persistence
- State transition validation

### Error Handling
Standardized error response format:
```
{
  error_code: string
  message: string
  details?: object
}
```

Key error scenarios:
- Mission already exists for date
- Invalid mission state transition
- Question index out of bounds
