## API Endpoints

### Mission Management
- GET `/missions/daily`: Retrieves user's daily set of 5 questions
- POST `/missions/submit`: Processes question answers and returns feedback
- GET `/missions/progress`: Returns mission completion status and attempt history

### Question Interaction
- POST `/questions/retry`: Resets question state for new attempt while preserving history
- GET `/questions/feedback`: Retrieves detailed feedback including explanation and correct answer

## Response Formats

### Mission Response Structure
```typescript
{
  missionId: string
  questions: Question[]
  progress: {
    completedCount: number
    totalQuestions: number
    attemptsRemaining: number
  }
}
```

### Question Feedback Structure
```typescript
{
  correct: boolean
  explanation: string
  correctAnswer: string
  attemptCount: number
  maxAttempts: number
  canRetry: boolean
}
```

## Error Handling

### Mission-Specific Errors
- `MISSION_NOT_FOUND`: Daily mission not yet generated
- `MAX_ATTEMPTS_REACHED`: No more retries available for question
- `INVALID_QUESTION_STATE`: Attempting to submit answer for completed question

### Progress Tracking
- Maintains attempt history across retries
- Tracks feedback viewing status per question
- Records completion status based on correct answers or max attempts reached

Importance Scores:
- Mission Response Format: 85 (Critical integration point for core functionality)
- Question Feedback Structure: 80 (Essential for user progression)
- Error Handling Patterns: 75 (Important for maintaining data integrity)
