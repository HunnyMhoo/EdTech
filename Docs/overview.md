# EdTech Platform Overview

The EdTech Platform aims to enhance the learning experience by providing daily engaging missions and educational content to students. It's designed to be a modular and scalable system supporting interactive learning modules.

## Major Features

The platform is currently focused on developing the **Daily Mission Feature**, which includes:
- Generation of daily unique missions for each user.
- Retrieval of today's mission.
- Tracking mission status (planned).
- Integration with a question pool for mission content.

Further features will be added as development progresses.

## Technology Stack

The technology stack is chosen for robustness, scalability, and developer productivity:
- **Frontend:** React Native (for cross-platform mobile application)
- **Backend:** Python with FastAPI (for high-performance asynchronous APIs)
- **Database:** MongoDB (for flexible data storage, using Mongoose ODM as per plan)

## Version & Timeline

- **Current Version:** 0.1.0 (as indicated in the backend API)
- **Development Status:** Actively in development. The initial focus is on implementing the core Daily Mission feature as outlined in the [Implementation Plan for User Story 1](Requirement/userstory/story1/implementation_plan.md). A detailed timeline for subsequent features is TBD.
