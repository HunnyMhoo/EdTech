## [2024-06-10] Daily Mission Schema & Unit Test Implementation
**Author:** Principal Software Engineer

### Summary
Implemented the foundational data model for the Daily Mission feature, enabling per-user, per-day mission tracking in MongoDB. Added comprehensive unit tests to ensure schema validation, default value assignment, and robust error handling.

### Details
- **Schema Definition:**
  - Created `backend/models/daily_mission.py` with a Pydantic model `DailyMissionDocument`.
  - Fields: `user_id` (str), `date` (datetime.date), `question_ids` (List[str], exactly 5), `status` (enum: not_started, in_progress, complete), `created_at` (datetime), `updated_at` (datetime).
  - Used `snake_case` for all database fields and model attributes.
  - Added `MissionStatus` enum for mission state management.
  - Included model config for OpenAPI schema example and enum serialization.
  - Documented index requirement for `(user_id, date)` uniqueness (to be implemented at DB/ODM layer).

- **Unit Testing:**
  - Added `backend/tests/unit/test_daily_mission_model.py` with `pytest`.
  - Test coverage includes:
    - Successful instantiation with valid data
    - Default value assignment for `status`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
    - Validation errors for missing required fields
    - Validation errors for incorrect data types
    - Validation for exact number of `question_ids`
    - Enum handling and error cases for `status`
    - Schema example validation
  - Used fixtures for reusable test data and parameterized tests for edge cases.

- **Engineering Standards:**
  - Explicit variable names and modular design
  - Comprehensive error handling and assertions in tests
  - No magic numbers; all constraints are named and documented
  - PEP 8 and Pydantic best practices followed

- **Next Steps:**
  - Integrate schema with mission generation and retrieval services
  - Implement database-level unique index for `(user_id, date)`
  - Manual verification via MongoDB Compass after service integration

# Implementation Progress Log

This document tracks the implementation progress of the EdTech Platform, grouped by component or feature scope.

## Backend: Daily Mission Feature

### Scope: Mission Retrieval API (Task 3 from User Story 1 Plan)

*   **Completed Functionalities:**
    *   API endpoint for retrieving today's (UTC+7) mission for a user.
    *   Service layer logic to fetch mission data (currently from a mock DB).
    *   Standardized API response model (`MissionResponse`).
    *   Placeholder for user authentication (hardcoded user ID).
    *   Error handling for mission not found (404) and server errors (500).
    *   Timezone-aware date handling for defining "today" (UTC+7).
    *   Basic health check endpoint for the API.
    *   Integration tests for the mission retrieval endpoint.

*   **File References:**
    *   Main application: [`backend/main.py`](../backend/main.py)
    *   API routes: [`backend/routes/missions.py`](../backend/routes/missions.py)
    *   Service logic: [`backend/services/mission_service.py`](../backend/services/mission_service.py) (specifically `get_todays_mission_for_user`, `_fetch_mission_from_db`, related Pydantic `DailyMission` model, and timezone utilities)
    *   API response models: [`backend/models/api_responses.py`](../backend/models/api_responses.py)
    *   Integration tests: [`backend/tests/integration/test_missions_api.py`](../backend/tests/integration/test_missions_api.py)

*   **Notes on Logic or Handled Cases:**
    *   The system correctly identifies "today" based on the UTC+7 timezone.
    *   The `mission_service.py` uses an in-memory dictionary (`_mock_db`) to simulate database interactions. This is sufficient for current development and testing but will need to be replaced with actual MongoDB integration.
    *   The `DailyMission` Pydantic model in `mission_service.py` is used for data structure and will be the basis for the actual `daily_mission.py` model file.
    *   User context in the API is currently hardcoded (`test_user_123`). This will be replaced by LINE Login integration.
    *   The API returns a `200 OK` with mission data on success, `404 Not Found` if no mission exists for the user for the day, and `500 Internal Server Error` for other issues.

## Partially Implemented / In Progress / To Do

Based on the initial [User Story 1 Implementation Plan](Requirement/userstory/story1/implementation_plan.md):

*   **Task 1: Define Daily Mission Data Schema (`backend/models/daily_mission.py`)**
    *   **Status:** Partially addressed. A Pydantic model `DailyMission` is defined in `backend/services/mission_service.py`. This needs to be moved to the designated `backend/models/daily_mission.py` and potentially refined with database-specific indexing (e.g., for MongoDB).
    *   No actual database schema or connection is set up yet.

*   **Task 2: Create Daily Mission Generation Service (`backend/services/mission_service.py`)**
    *   **Status:** Partially implemented. The `generate_daily_mission` function exists and uses a CSV for questions and a mock DB. It includes logic for random question selection and checks for existing missions.
    *   Needs integration with the official `DailyMission` schema (Task 1) and actual database persistence.

*   **Task 4: Integrate Mission API into React Native App (`frontend/screens/HomeScreen.tsx`)**
    *   **Status:** Not started.

*   **Task 5: Handle Mission Resume on Reopen (`frontend/screens/MissionScreen.tsx`)**
    *   **Status:** Not started.

*   **Task 6: Implement Daily Reset Backend Job (`backend/jobs/daily_reset.py`)**
    *   **Status:** Not started.

*   **General:**
    *   Full LINE Login integration.
    *   Migration from mock DB to a real MongoDB instance.
    *   Migration of question pool from CSV to database.
    *   Comprehensive unit tests for all service logic (beyond current integration tests).
