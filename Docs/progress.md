## [2024-06-10] Daily Mission Schema & Unit Test Implementation
**Author:** Principal Software Engineer

### Summary
Implemented the foundational data model for the Daily Mission feature, enabling per-user, per-day mission tracking in MongoDB. Added comprehensive unit tests to ensure schema validation, default value assignment, and robust error handling.

### Details
- **Schema Definition:**
  - Created `backend/models/daily_mission.py` with a Pydantic model `DailyMissionDocument`.
  - Fields: `user_id` (str), `date` (datetime.date), `question_ids` (List[str], exactly 5), `status` (enum: not_started, in_progress, complete), `created_at` (datetime), `updated_at` (datetime).
  - Used `snake_case` for all database fields and model attributes.
  - Added `MissionStatus` enum for mission state management.
  - Included model config for OpenAPI schema example and enum serialization.
  - Documented index requirement for `(user_id, date)` uniqueness (to be implemented at DB/ODM layer).

- **Unit Testing:**
  - Added `backend/tests/unit/test_daily_mission_model.py` with `pytest`.
  - Test coverage includes:
    - Successful instantiation with valid data
    - Default value assignment for `status`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
    - Validation errors for missing required fields
    - Validation errors for incorrect data types
    - Validation for exact number of `question_ids`
    - Enum handling and error cases for `status`
    - Schema example validation
  - Used fixtures for reusable test data and parameterized tests for edge cases.

- **Engineering Standards:**
  - Explicit variable names and modular design
  - Comprehensive error handling and assertions in tests
  - No magic numbers; all constraints are named and documented
  - PEP 8 and Pydantic best practices followed

- **Next Steps:**
  - Integrate schema with mission generation and retrieval services
  - Implement database-level unique index for `(user_id, date)`
  - Manual verification via MongoDB Compass after service integration

## Backend: Daily Mission Feature

### Scope: Mission Retrieval API (Task 3 from User Story 1 Plan)

*   **Completed Functionalities:**
    *   API endpoint for retrieving today's (UTC+7) mission for a user.
    *   Service layer logic to fetch mission data (currently from a mock DB).
    *   Standardized API response model (`MissionResponse`).
    *   Placeholder for user authentication (hardcoded user ID).
    *   Error handling for mission not found (404) and server errors (500).
    *   Timezone-aware date handling for defining "today" (UTC+7).
    *   Basic health check endpoint for the API.
    *   Integration tests for the mission retrieval endpoint.

*   **File References:**
    *   Main application: [`backend/main.py`](../backend/main.py)
    *   API routes: [`backend/routes/missions.py`](../backend/routes/missions.py)
    *   Service logic: [`backend/services/mission_service.py`](../backend/services/mission_service.py) (specifically `get_todays_mission_for_user`, `_fetch_mission_from_db`, related Pydantic `DailyMission` model, and timezone utilities)
    *   API response models: [`backend/models/api_responses.py`](../backend/models/api_responses.py)
    *   Integration tests: [`backend/tests/integration/test_missions_api.py`](../backend/tests/integration/test_missions_api.py)

*   **Notes on Logic or Handled Cases:**
    *   The system correctly identifies "today" based on the UTC+7 timezone.
    *   The `mission_service.py` uses an in-memory dictionary (`_mock_db`) to simulate database interactions. This is sufficient for current development and testing but will need to be replaced with actual MongoDB integration.
    *   The `DailyMission` Pydantic model in `mission_service.py` is used for data structure and will be the basis for the actual `daily_mission.py` model file.
    *   User context in the API is currently hardcoded (`test_user_123`). This will be replaced by LINE Login integration.
    *   The API returns a `200 OK` with mission data on success, `404 Not Found` if no mission exists for the user for the day, and `500 Internal Server Error` for other issues.

## [YYYY-MM-DD] Frontend Daily Mission Display (Task 4)
**Author:** Principal Software Engineer

### Summary
Implemented the initial frontend integration for the Daily Mission feature. This includes a React Native screen to fetch and display mission data from the (currently mocked) backend API, along with loading and error states. A dedicated API service module was created for frontend-backend communication, and unit tests were established for this service.

### Details
- **API Service (`frontend/services/missionApi.ts`):**
  - Created `fetchDailyMission` function to retrieve daily mission data.
  - Currently uses a mocked API response within the service itself, simulating a network delay and returning a predefined mission structure.
  - Includes TypeScript interfaces (`Mission`, `Question`) for data structure.
  - Basic error handling and console logging for API call failures.
- **HomeScreen Component (`frontend/screens/HomeScreen.tsx`):**
  - React Native functional component using `useState` and `useEffect` hooks.
  - Fetches mission data on component mount via `fetchDailyMission`.
  - Manages and displays three states:
    - Loading: Shows an `ActivityIndicator` and loading text.
    - Error: Shows an error message and a "Try Again" button.
    - Success: Displays the mission questions (or a "No mission" message).
  - Uses basic React Native `StyleSheet` for styling, with placeholders for future TailwindCSS integration.
- **Unit Testing (`frontend/services/__tests__/missionApi.test.ts`):**
  - Basic Jest test suite for `fetchDailyMission`.
  - Mocks `global.fetch` (though not currently used by `fetchDailyMission` due to its internal mock).
  - Tests currently verify the behavior of the service with its own mocked data. Tests for actual `fetch` calls are commented out, pending removal of the internal mock in `missionApi.ts`.
  - Linter errors related to missing Jest types (`@types/jest`) were noted but not resolved as part_of this task, as it typically requires project-level dependency setup.

### Engineering Standards Followed:
- Modular design (API service separated from screen component).
- Explicit variable names.
- Handling of loading, error, and data states in the UI.
- Placeholder for comprehensive error handling (e.g., remote logging).
- Unit tests for the API service layer.

### Next Steps (for Frontend Task 4 & related):
- Replace internal mock in `missionApi.ts` with actual `fetch` calls to the backend.
- Uncomment and adapt unit tests in `missionApi.test.ts` for real fetch scenarios.
- Integrate a styling solution like TailwindCSS.
- Implement full UI/UX for question interaction and mission submission (part of subsequent tasks).
- Address linter errors by ensuring appropriate type definitions are installed and configured in the frontend project.

## [YYYY-MM-DD] Mission Resume and Progress Persistence (Task 5)
**Author:** Principal Software Engineer

### Summary
Implemented the mission resume functionality, enabling users to continue their daily missions from where they left off. This involved backend changes to store and retrieve mission progress (current question index and answers) and frontend updates to manage and display this persisted state.

### Details

-   **Backend Enhancements (`backend/`):**
    -   **`models/daily_mission.py`**:
        -   Added `current_question_index: int` (default 0) and `answers: List[Dict[str, Any]]` (default empty list) to the `DailyMissionDocument` Pydantic model.
        -   Updated `schema_extra` to include these new fields in the example.
    -   **`services/mission_service.py`**:
        -   Refactored to consistently use `DailyMissionDocument` from `backend.models.daily_mission`.
        -   Updated the mock database (`_mock_db_missions`) and its interaction functions (`_find_mission_in_db`, `_save_mission_to_db`, `_fetch_mission_from_db`) to handle `DailyMissionDocument` instances and the new progress fields.
        -   The `get_todays_mission_for_user` service function now returns the full mission document, including `current_question_index` and `answers`.
        -   Added a new service function `update_mission_progress(user_id, current_question_index, answers, status)` to save the user's progress and optionally update the mission status.
        -   Adjusted `generate_daily_mission` to correctly initialize new `DailyMissionDocument` instances respecting default values for progress fields.
    -   **`routes/missions.py`**:
        -   Updated imports to use `DailyMissionDocument` from models and new/updated service functions.
        -   Added `MissionProgressUpdatePayload` Pydantic model for the request body of the progress update endpoint.
        -   Modified `GET /api/missions/today` endpoint (`get_today_mission_for_current_user`) to ensure its `response_model` reflects that `DailyMissionDocument` (including progress) is returned.
        -   Created new endpoint `PUT /api/missions/today/progress` (`update_today_mission_progress`) to receive progress updates from the frontend and use the `update_mission_progress` service.
    -   **`models/api_responses.py`**:
        -   Modified `MissionResponse` to be a generic model (`MissionResponse[DataType]`) to correctly type API responses containing different data structures like `DailyMissionDocument`.

-   **Frontend Enhancements (`frontend/`):**
    -   **`services/missionApi.ts`**:
        -   Updated `Mission` and `Question` interfaces to align with the backend's `DailyMissionDocument`, including fields like `user_id`, `question_ids` (instead of full question objects), `current_question_index`, `answers`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`.
        -   Added an `Answer` interface.
        -   Defined a generic `ApiResponse<T>` interface to correctly parse wrapped backend responses.
        -   Modified `fetchDailyMission` to make an actual `GET` request to the `/api/missions/today` backend endpoint and parse the `ApiResponse<Mission>`. Removed previous mock data logic from this function.
        -   Added `MissionProgressUpdatePayload` interface for the frontend to structure data sent to the backend.
        -   Created `updateMissionProgressApi` function to make a `PUT` request to `/api/missions/today/progress` with the progress payload.
        -   Added `API_BASE_URL` constant.
    -   **`screens/MissionScreen.tsx` (New File):**
        -   Created a new React Native functional component responsible for the active mission interaction.
        -   Manages state for the loaded `mission`, `currentQuestionIndex`, `userAnswers`, the `currentAnswer` being typed, loading status, and error messages.
        -   On component mount (`useEffect`), calls `fetchDailyMission` to load the mission. If progress exists (`current_question_index`, `answers`), the UI initializes to that state.
        -   Implements `handleSaveProgress` function, which calls `updateMissionProgressApi` to persist changes to the backend. This function also updates the mission `status` based on the number of answers.
        -   Provides UI for displaying the current question (using `question_id` as placeholder text), an input field for the answer, and buttons for "Submit Answer", "Previous", and "Next".
        -   Handles basic loading and error display during API calls.
        -   `handleAnswerSubmit` updates local `userAnswers` and triggers `handleSaveProgress`.
        -   `handleNextQuestion` and `handlePreviousQuestion` update `currentQuestionIndex`, load any existing answer for the target question, and trigger `handleSaveProgress`.

### Engineering Standards Followed:
-   Modular design across backend (models, services, routes) and frontend (services, screens).
-   Clear API contracts with typed request/response models (Pydantic on backend, TypeScript interfaces on frontend).
-   State management in frontend component for UI reactivity.
-   Error handling for API interactions on both frontend and backend.
-   Placeholder for more detailed question rendering on the frontend (currently shows question ID).

### Next Steps:
-   **Testing:**
    -   Write comprehensive unit tests for `MissionScreen.tsx` covering state changes, API call mocks, and user interactions.
    -   Add backend unit tests for `update_mission_progress` service function and the `PUT /api/missions/today/progress` route handler.
    -   Perform manual end-to-end testing of the mission resume flow.
-   **Frontend Polish:**
    -   Implement actual rendering of question text and options in `MissionScreen.tsx` instead of just IDs. This might involve fetching question details separately or embedding them in the `Mission` object from the backend.
    -   Address React Native linter errors related to missing type declarations for 'react' and 'react-native' (project setup issue).
-   **Backend:**
    -   Transition from mock DB to a real MongoDB instance for persistence.

## Partially Implemented / In Progress / To Do

Based on the initial [User Story 1 Implementation Plan](Requirement/userstory/story1/implementation_plan.md):

*   **Task 1: Define Daily Mission Data Schema (`backend/models/daily_mission.py`)**
    *   **Status:** Completed. `DailyMissionDocument` in `backend/models/daily_mission.py` now includes all fields for mission data and progress.
*   **Task 2: Create Daily Mission Generation Service (`backend/services/mission_service.py`)**
    *   **Status:** Significantly updated. `mission_service.py` now uses `DailyMissionDocument` consistently.
    *   Still uses a mock DB; actual database persistence is pending.
*   **Task 3: Create Mission Retrieval API Endpoint (`backend/routes/missions.py`)**
    *   **Status:** Completed and enhanced. `GET /api/missions/today` returns mission with progress. `PUT /api/missions/today/progress` endpoint added for saving progress.
*   **Task 4: Integrate Mission API into React Native App (`frontend/screens/HomeScreen.tsx`)**
    *   **Status:** `frontend/services/missionApi.ts` is now making actual calls. `HomeScreen.tsx` might need updates if it directly uses `fetchDailyMission` and expects the now more detailed `Mission` object. The primary mission interaction with progress is now in `MissionScreen.tsx`.
*   **Task 5: Handle Mission Resume on Reopen (`frontend/screens/MissionScreen.tsx`)**
    *   **Status:** Completed. `MissionScreen.tsx` created and implements fetching, displaying, and saving mission progress.
*   **Task 6: Implement Daily Reset Backend Job (`backend/jobs/daily_reset.py`)**
    *   **Status:** Not started.

*   **General:**
    *   Full LINE Login integration.
    *   Migration from mock DB to a real MongoDB instance.
    *   Migration of question pool from CSV to database.
    *   Comprehensive unit tests for all new/modified service logic and components.
