## [2024-06-10] Daily Mission Schema & Unit Test Implementation
**Author:** Principal Software Engineer

### Summary
Implemented the foundational data model for the Daily Mission feature, enabling per-user, per-day mission tracking in MongoDB. Added comprehensive unit tests to ensure schema validation, default value assignment, and robust error handling.

### Details
- **Schema Definition:**
  - Created `backend/models/daily_mission.py` with a Pydantic model `DailyMissionDocument`.
  - Fields: `user_id` (str), `date` (datetime.date), `question_ids` (List[str], exactly 5), `status` (enum: not_started, in_progress, complete), `created_at` (datetime), `updated_at` (datetime).
  - Used `snake_case` for all database fields and model attributes.
  - Added `MissionStatus` enum for mission state management.
  - Included model config for OpenAPI schema example and enum serialization.
  - Documented index requirement for `(user_id, date)` uniqueness (to be implemented at DB/ODM layer).

- **Unit Testing:**
  - Added `backend/tests/unit/test_daily_mission_model.py` with `pytest`.
  - Test coverage includes:
    - Successful instantiation with valid data
    - Default value assignment for `status`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
    - Validation errors for missing required fields
    - Validation errors for incorrect data types
    - Validation for exact number of `question_ids`
    - Enum handling and error cases for `status`
    - Schema example validation
  - Used fixtures for reusable test data and parameterized tests for edge cases.

- **Engineering Standards:**
  - Explicit variable names and modular design
  - Comprehensive error handling and assertions in tests
  - No magic numbers; all constraints are named and documented
  - PEP 8 and Pydantic best practices followed

- **Next Steps:**
  - Integrate schema with mission generation and retrieval services
  - Implement database-level unique index for `(user_id, date)`
  - Manual verification via MongoDB Compass after service integration

# Implementation Progress Log

This document tracks the implementation progress of the EdTech Platform, grouped by component or feature scope.

## Backend: Daily Mission Feature

### Scope: Mission Retrieval API (Task 3 from User Story 1 Plan)

*   **Completed Functionalities:**
    *   API endpoint for retrieving today's (UTC+7) mission for a user.
    *   Service layer logic to fetch mission data (currently from a mock DB).
    *   Standardized API response model (`MissionResponse`).
    *   Placeholder for user authentication (hardcoded user ID).
    *   Error handling for mission not found (404) and server errors (500).
    *   Timezone-aware date handling for defining "today" (UTC+7).
    *   Basic health check endpoint for the API.
    *   Integration tests for the mission retrieval endpoint.

*   **File References:**
    *   Main application: [`backend/main.py`](../backend/main.py)
    *   API routes: [`backend/routes/missions.py`](../backend/routes/missions.py)
    *   Service logic: [`backend/services/mission_service.py`](../backend/services/mission_service.py) (specifically `get_todays_mission_for_user`, `_fetch_mission_from_db`, related Pydantic `DailyMission` model, and timezone utilities)
    *   API response models: [`backend/models/api_responses.py`](../backend/models/api_responses.py)
    *   Integration tests: [`backend/tests/integration/test_missions_api.py`](../backend/tests/integration/test_missions_api.py)

*   **Notes on Logic or Handled Cases:**
    *   The system correctly identifies "today" based on the UTC+7 timezone.
    *   The `mission_service.py` uses an in-memory dictionary (`_mock_db`) to simulate database interactions. This is sufficient for current development and testing but will need to be replaced with actual MongoDB integration.
    *   The `DailyMission` Pydantic model in `mission_service.py` is used for data structure and will be the basis for the actual `daily_mission.py` model file.
    *   User context in the API is currently hardcoded (`test_user_123`). This will be replaced by LINE Login integration.
    *   The API returns a `200 OK` with mission data on success, `404 Not Found` if no mission exists for the user for the day, and `500 Internal Server Error` for other issues.

## [Current Date - YYYY-MM-DD] Frontend: Interactive Question Display & Navigation
**Author:** AI Assistant (Gemini)

### Summary
Enhanced the frontend `HomeScreen.tsx` to provide an interactive experience for daily missions. Users can now view one question at a time, navigate between questions using "Previous" and "Next" buttons, and input their answers. This sets the stage for saving progress and submitting missions.

### Details
- **Component State Management (`frontend/screens/HomeScreen.tsx`):**
  - Introduced `currentQuestionDisplayIndex` state to track the active question.
  - Added `userAnswers` state (a `Record<string, string>`) to store answers entered by the user, mapping `question_id` to the answer text.

- **UI Enhancements & Navigation (`frontend/screens/HomeScreen.tsx`):**
  - Modified the render logic to display only the question corresponding to `currentQuestionDisplayIndex` from the `mission.questions` array.
  - Added "Previous" and "Next" buttons for navigating through the questions.
    - Button states (enabled/disabled) are managed based on the current index and total number of questions.
  - Implemented `handleNextQuestion` and `handlePreviousQuestion` functions to update `currentQuestionDisplayIndex`.
  - Added a `TextInput` component for the current question, allowing users to type their answers.
    - The `value` of the `TextInput` is bound to `userAnswers[currentQuestion.question_id]`.
    - `onChangeText` calls `handleAnswerChange(questionId, text)` to update the `userAnswers` state.
  - Included a progress indicator displaying "Question X of Y".

- **Styling:**
  - Added basic styles for the new `TextInput` and the navigation container elements.

### Engineering Standards Followed:
- Component-level state management for UI interactivity.
- Clear separation of concerns for navigation and answer handling logic within the component.
- User-friendly navigation with disabled states for buttons at boundaries.

### Next Steps:
- Implement functionality to save `userAnswers` to the backend via `updateMissionProgressApi`.
- Add a "Submit Mission" button and related logic.
- Further UI/UX refinements for answer input and feedback.
- Unit tests for the new interactive elements and state logic in `HomeScreen.tsx`.

## [YYYY-MM-DD] Mission Resume and Progress Persistence (Task 5)
**Author:** Principal Software Engineer

### Summary
Implemented the mission resume functionality, enabling users to continue their daily missions from where they left off. This involved backend changes to store and retrieve mission progress (current question index and answers) and frontend updates to manage and display this persisted state.

### Details

-   **Backend Enhancements (`backend/`):**
    -   **`models/daily_mission.py`**:
        -   Added `current_question_index: int` (default 0) and `answers: List[Dict[str, Any]]` (default empty list) to the `DailyMissionDocument` Pydantic model.
        -   Updated `schema_extra` to include these new fields in the example.
    -   **`services/mission_service.py`**:
        -   Refactored to consistently use `DailyMissionDocument` from `backend.models.daily_mission`.
        -   Updated the mock database (`_mock_db_missions`) and its interaction functions (`_find_mission_in_db`, `_save_mission_to_db`, `_fetch_mission_from_db`) to handle `DailyMissionDocument` instances and the new progress fields.
        -   The `get_todays_mission_for_user` service function now returns the full mission document, including `current_question_index` and `answers`.
        -   Added a new service function `update_mission_progress(user_id, current_question_index, answers, status)` to save the user's progress and optionally update the mission status.
        -   Adjusted `generate_daily_mission` to correctly initialize new `DailyMissionDocument` instances respecting default values for progress fields.
    -   **`routes/missions.py`**:
        -   Updated imports to use `DailyMissionDocument` from models and new/updated service functions.
        -   Added `MissionProgressUpdatePayload` Pydantic model for the request body of the progress update endpoint.
        -   Modified `GET /api/missions/today` endpoint (`get_today_mission_for_current_user`) to ensure its `response_model` reflects that `DailyMissionDocument` (including progress) is returned.
        -   Created new endpoint `PUT /api/missions/today/progress` (`update_today_mission_progress`) to receive progress updates from the frontend and use the `update_mission_progress` service.
    -   **`models/api_responses.py`**:
        -   Modified `MissionResponse` to be a generic model (`MissionResponse[DataType]`) to correctly type API responses containing different data structures like `DailyMissionDocument`.

-   **Frontend Enhancements (`frontend/`):**
    -   **`services/missionApi.ts`**:
        -   Updated `Mission` and `Question` interfaces to align with the backend's `DailyMissionDocument`, including fields like `user_id`, `question_ids` (instead of full question objects), `current_question_index`, `answers`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`.
        -   Added an `Answer` interface.
        -   Defined a generic `ApiResponse<T>` interface to correctly parse wrapped backend responses.
        -   Modified `fetchDailyMission` to make an actual `GET` request to the `/api/missions/today` backend endpoint and parse the `ApiResponse<Mission>`. Removed previous mock data logic from this function.
        -   Added `MissionProgressUpdatePayload` interface for the frontend to structure data sent to the backend.
        -   Created `updateMissionProgressApi` function to make a `PUT` request to `/api/missions/today/progress` with the progress payload.
        -   Added `API_BASE_URL` constant.
    -   **`screens/MissionScreen.tsx` (New File):**
        -   Created a new React Native functional component responsible for the active mission interaction.
        -   Manages state for the loaded `mission`, `currentQuestionIndex`, `userAnswers`, the `currentAnswer` being typed, loading status, and error messages.
        -   On component mount (`useEffect`), calls `fetchDailyMission` to load the mission. If progress exists (`current_question_index`, `answers`), the UI initializes to that state.
        -   Implements `handleSaveProgress` function, which calls `updateMissionProgressApi` to persist changes to the backend. This function also updates the mission `status` based on the number of answers.
        -   Provides UI for displaying the current question (using `question_id` as placeholder text), an input field for the answer, and buttons for "Submit Answer", "Previous", and "Next".
        -   Handles basic loading and error display during API calls.
        -   `handleAnswerSubmit` updates local `userAnswers` and triggers `handleSaveProgress`.
        -   `handleNextQuestion` and `handlePreviousQuestion` update `currentQuestionIndex`, load any existing answer for the target question, and trigger `handleSaveProgress`.

### Engineering Standards Followed:
-   Modular design across backend (models, services, routes) and frontend (services, screens).
-   Clear API contracts with typed request/response models (Pydantic on backend, TypeScript interfaces on frontend).
-   State management in frontend component for UI reactivity.
-   Error handling for API interactions on both frontend and backend.
-   Placeholder for more detailed question rendering on the frontend (currently shows question ID).

### Next Steps:
-   **Testing:**
    -   Write comprehensive unit tests for `MissionScreen.tsx` covering state changes, API call mocks, and user interactions.
    -   Add backend unit tests for `update_mission_progress` service function and the `PUT /api/missions/today/progress` route handler.
    -   Perform manual end-to-end testing of the mission resume flow.
-   **Frontend Polish:**
    -   Implement actual rendering of question text and options in `MissionScreen.tsx` instead of just IDs. This might involve fetching question details separately or embedding them in the `Mission` object from the backend.
    -   Address React Native linter errors related to missing type declarations for 'react' and 'react-native' (project setup issue).
-   **Backend:**
    -   Transition from mock DB to a real MongoDB instance for persistence.

## Partially Implemented / In Progress / To Do

Based on the initial [User Story 1 Implementation Plan](Requirement/userstory/story1/implementation_plan.md):

*   **Task 1: Define Daily Mission Data Schema (`backend/models/daily_mission.py`)**
    *   **Status:** Completed. `DailyMissionDocument` in `backend/models/daily_mission.py` now includes all fields for mission data and progress.
*   **Task 2: Create Daily Mission Generation Service (`backend/services/mission_service.py`)**
    *   **Status:** Significantly updated. `mission_service.py` now uses `DailyMissionDocument` consistently.
    *   Still uses a mock DB; actual database persistence is pending.
*   **Task 3: Create Mission Retrieval API Endpoint (`backend/routes/missions.py`)**
    *   **Status:** Completed and enhanced. `GET /api/missions/today` returns mission with progress. `PUT /api/missions/today/progress` endpoint added for saving progress.
*   **Task 4: Integrate Mission API into React Native App (`frontend/screens/HomeScreen.tsx`)**
    *   **Status:** `frontend/services/missionApi.ts` is now making actual calls. `HomeScreen.tsx` might need updates if it directly uses `fetchDailyMission` and expects the now more detailed `Mission` object. The primary mission interaction with progress is now in `MissionScreen.tsx`.
*   **Task 5: Handle Mission Resume on Reopen (`frontend/screens/MissionScreen.tsx`)**
    *   **Status:** Completed. `MissionScreen.tsx` created and implements fetching, displaying, and saving mission progress.
*   **Task 6: Implement Daily Reset Backend Job (`backend/jobs/daily_reset.py`)**
    *   **Status:** Completed. Implemented an in-app scheduled job (APScheduler) to archive old, incomplete missions daily at 4 AM UTC. Logic resides in `backend/jobs/daily_reset.py`, service function `archive_past_incomplete_missions` in `backend/services/mission_service.py`, and scheduler configured in `backend/main.py`. `MissionStatus` enum updated with `ARCHIVED`.

*   **General:**
    *   Full LINE Login integration.
    *   Migration from mock DB to a real MongoDB instance.
    *   Migration of question pool from CSV to database.
    *   Comprehensive unit tests for all new/modified service logic and components.

## [2024-07-25] Daily Mission Reset Job (Task 6)
**Author:** Principal Software Engineer

### Summary
Implemented an automated daily job to reset/archive past missions. This ensures users are presented with fresh missions daily as per UTC+7 timezone logic. The job is scheduled using an in-app scheduler (APScheduler) and updates the status of old, incomplete missions to "archived".

### Details
-   **Data Model Enhancement (`backend/models/daily_mission.py`):**
    -   Added `ARCHIVED = "archived"` to the `MissionStatus` enum in `DailyMissionDocument`.
-   **Service Layer (`backend/services/mission_service.py`):**
    -   Created a new asynchronous function `archive_past_incomplete_missions()`.
    -   This function identifies missions with a `date` before the current UTC+7 date and whose `status` is neither `COMPLETE` nor `ARCHIVED`.
    -   It updates the `status` of these missions to `ARCHIVED` and updates their `updated_at` timestamp.
    -   Uses the existing `_mock_db_missions` list and `_save_mission_to_db` for mock persistence.
    -   Includes logging for the number of missions archived.
-   **Job Implementation (`backend/jobs/daily_reset.py`):**
    -   Created a new file to house the job logic.
    -   Defined an asynchronous function `run_daily_reset_job()` that calls `archive_past_incomplete_missions()`.
    -   Implemented logging for job start, completion, and any errors encountered during execution.
-   **Scheduler Integration (`backend/main.py`):**
    -   Integrated `APScheduler` (specifically `AsyncIOScheduler`) into the FastAPI application.
    -   The `run_daily_reset_job` is scheduled to run daily at 04:00 UTC.
    -   The scheduler is started on FastAPI application startup and shut down gracefully on application shutdown.
    -   Added logging for scheduler events (start, shutdown, job scheduling).
-   **Unit Testing:**
    -   **`backend/tests/unit/test_daily_mission_model.py`**: Added tests to verify the new `ARCHIVED` status in `MissionStatus` enum.
    -   **`backend/tests/unit/test_mission_service.py`**: Created new tests for `archive_past_incomplete_missions`, covering scenarios like:
        -   No missions to archive.
        -   Only current day missions (should not be archived).
        -   Archiving past incomplete missions while leaving completed/already archived/current missions untouched.
        -   Correctly updating `status` and `updated_at` fields.
        -   Uses a fixture to clear `_mock_db_missions` before each test.
    -   **`backend/tests/unit/test_daily_reset_job.py`**: Created new tests for `run_daily_reset_job`, covering:
        -   Successful job execution and logging.
        -   Job execution when the service layer archives zero missions.
        -   Error handling and logging when the service layer raises `MissionGenerationError` or other exceptions.
        -   Uses `unittest.mock.patch` for service calls and `caplog` fixture for log verification.

### Engineering Standards Followed:
-   Modular design: Job logic separated in `jobs` package, service logic in `services`.
-   In-app scheduling preferred for managing the job lifecycle with the application.
-   Soft-delete strategy (`ARCHIVED` status) for missions, preserving data.
-   Comprehensive logging for the job and scheduler operations.
-   Timezone consistency: Scheduler operates in UTC, job logic uses UTC+7 for mission dates.
-   Unit tests cover new model states, service logic, and job execution, including error handling.

### Next Steps:
-   Manual verification of the scheduler and job by temporarily adjusting schedule frequency and observing mock DB state and logs.
-   Ensure `APScheduler` is added to project dependencies (e.g., `requirements.txt`).
-   Transition from mock DB to a real MongoDB instance will require updating `archive_past_incomplete_missions` to use actual DB queries and updates.

## [2024-07-09] Question Metadata API (Task 3, User Story 2)
**Author:** Principal Software Engineer

### Summary
Implemented a new backend API endpoint to fetch full question metadata by ID, supporting lazy loading of question details (including choices and feedback) for frontend consumption. This enables the frontend to retrieve question text, choices, and Thai feedback on demand, keeping mission payloads lightweight and improving modularity.

### Details
- **Data Model Enhancements (`backend/models/daily_mission.py`):**
  - Introduced `ChoiceOption` Pydantic model for structured multiple-choice options.
  - Extended the `Question` model to include:
    - `choices: List[ChoiceOption]` for answer options.
    - `correct_answer_id: Optional[str]` to indicate the correct choice.
  - Updated schema examples for OpenAPI documentation.

- **CSV Loading Logic (`backend/services/mission_service.py`):**
  - Updated `_load_questions_from_csv` to parse new columns: `choice_1_id`, `choice_1_text`, ..., `choice_4_id`, `choice_4_text`, and `correct_answer_id`.
  - Populates the extended `Question` model with choices and correct answer from the CSV.
  - Added robust error handling and logging for malformed or missing choice data.
  - Added `get_question_details_by_id(question_id: str)` service function for efficient question lookup.

- **API Endpoint (`backend/routes/questions.py`):**
  - Created a new FastAPI router with `GET /questions/{question_id}` endpoint.
  - Returns the full `Question` object (including choices and feedback) or a 404 error if not found.
  - Includes OpenAPI documentation and descriptive error messages.

- **Integration Tests (`backend/tests/integration/test_questions_route.py`):**
  - Added tests for successful retrieval, not-found (404), and path parameter validation.
  - Used FastAPI's `TestClient` and `unittest.mock.patch` for service layer isolation.
  - Ensured all tests pass with 100% success rate.

### Engineering Standards Followed
- Modular design: clear separation between data models, service logic, and API routes.
- Explicit variable names and type annotations for clarity.
- Robust error handling and logging for data parsing and API errors.
- Comprehensive automated test coverage for new endpoint.
- No magic numbers; all choice-related logic uses named fields.
- PEP 8 and FastAPI best practices for code and documentation.

### Next Steps
- Update `backend/data/gat_questions.csv` to include choice and correct answer columns for all questions.
- Integrate the new `/questions/{id}` endpoint into the frontend for lazy loading of question details.
- Monitor and optimize performance as the question pool grows.
- Expand test coverage for edge cases (e.g., questions with missing or malformed choices).
